## Short Description
Body Mass Index or abbreviated as BMI is one way to find out your ideal body weight as measured by your weight and height. By calculating it using the BMI formula, you can see if your weight status is in the normal, underweight, overweight, or even obese categories

If your BMI is:
* below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range
* between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range
* between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range
* between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the obese range
